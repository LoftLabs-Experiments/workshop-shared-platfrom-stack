# 🏗️ About This Workshop  

## **🚀 Seamless Kubernetes Multi-Tenancy with vCluster & a Shared Platform Stack**  

### **Why Multi-Tenancy?**  
As organizations scale, managing multiple teams and workloads efficiently within a single Kubernetes cluster becomes a challenge. Multi-tenancy allows teams to share a cluster while maintaining isolation, reducing infrastructure costs, and improving security.  

This workshop introduces **vCluster**, a powerful tool for implementing **Kubernetes multi-tenancy** using virtual clusters. You will learn how to create and manage vClusters while leveraging a shared platform stack, including **cert-manager** for seamless TLS management and **Ingress controllers** for secure application routing.  

---

## **📌 What You Will Learn**  
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:  
✅ Set up **vCluster** inside a Kubernetes cluster.  
✅ Enable **cert-manager integration** for automated TLS certificate management.  
✅ Deploy **applications inside vCluster** while using host cluster resources.  
✅ Configure **Ingress for external access** and secure apps with **HTTPS**.  
✅ Use **GitHub Pages** to publish workshop materials for participants.

## **🛠️ Workshop Prerequisites**  
To follow along with this workshop, make sure you have:  
- **A Kubernetes cluster** (local or cloud-based).  
- `kubectl` installed and configured.  
- The latest version of `vcluster` CLI.  
- Installed `cert-manager` and `nginx` Ingress Controller.  
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress).  

If you are new to vCluster, **don’t worry!** This workshop provides step-by-step instructions.
